# Project Name
> In this project we have to make a multiple linear regression model to predict the number of bike sharing user and the factor affecting these counts i.e finding out the driving variables 


## Table of Contents
* [General Info] -We have been provided with the data which contains 730 datapoints which have 16 features and using this data we have to make a multiple linear regression model with target variables cnt using this data 
* [Technologies Used] - we have used linear regression algorithm ,Sklearn and statsmodel packages 
* [Conclusions]- we have fitted the Multiple linear regression model using this data and obtained adjusted R squared value of 83.7% on train data and 77.7% on test data 
* [Acknowledgements] I Rishabh Jain would like to thanks all mentor from IIIT -B and upgrad for helping to complete this assignment



## General Information
- The project was to find the cnt values for bike sharing company 
- In the project we have to build a model and find the driving features which will help in increase the cnt value which will help the company to increase the profit 
- A CSV file was used which contains 730 rows and 16 columns 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The column atemp is the most important column in driving the target variable
- The categorical column yr is also positively driving the target variable 
- The feature weathersit and season negatively driving the target variable 

## Technologies Used
- library - Sklearn
- library - Numpy
- library - Pandas
- library - matplotlib
- library - Seaborn
- library - Statsmodel


## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by Business problem of bike sharing company
